## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the home of [bro](https://github.com/lameaux/bro), a load testing tool, and [mox](https://github.com/lameaux/mox), a tool to stub external dependencies. 

Have you ever been asked by your boss to determine the number of requests your service can handle?

How do you approach this task? Do you estimate, check historical data, or run simulations?

The only reliable way to provide a confident answer is to **simulate** the load. 

Visit [website](https://lameaux.github.io/) and check out [nft repo](https://github.com/lameaux/nft) to see my tools in action!
